# LCD display controller project

In this project we develop an 1602 LCD display controller based on CPLD Development Board. These alphanumeric displays include an integrated HD44780-compatible controller with a parallel interface that enables you to send data in ASCII format one byte at a time. The output is two lines of 16 characters each on a fixed dot matrix grid.


## Validation of the design of the LCD display controller project on the OpenEPM1270 , CPLD Development Board
